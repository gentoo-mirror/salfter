Post-Installation
=================

After installing COPS to a webroot directory, change to it and complete the
following:

* wget https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar
* php composer.phar require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.1"

Then, copy config_local.php.example to config_local.php and set your Calibre
library directory in config_local.php.
